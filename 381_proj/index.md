# The Great Shrinking Lake
## Final Project for GES 381: Remote Sensing

This presentation was given as my final project for my remote sensing course at UMBC. It uses R and Google Earth Engine to analyze the relationship between the changing water area of the Great Salt Lake since 1986 and the growing population of the Wasatch Front and the Utah Valley. You can view the animated timeseries of the lake [here](/381_proj/bin)
