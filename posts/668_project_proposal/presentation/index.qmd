# Introduction

## Why this is important

-   Since the advent of aircraft, land management policy has been to put out wildfires immediately, even in the face of ecosystem needs
    -   Protection of people, property, and prosperity [@westover_2023_only]
    -   Species such as lodgepole pine (*P. contorta*) and wild lupine (*L. perennis*) require fire

## Why this is important

-   Davies et al. [-@davies2018] found that majority Black, Hispanic, and Native American areas were disproportionately impacted by wildfire
    -   About twice as vulnerable to wildfire impacts when compared to other census tracts

```{r}
#| echo: false

# Optionally source functions from `functions.R` script
funs <- list.files(here::here("posts/668_project_proposal/R"), full.names = T)
lapply(funs, source)
```

## Initial goals

My initial goals for this project were to:

-   Identify sources of spatial data related to historic wildfire perimeters
-   Use ACS data to estimate impacts of disasters between Decennial Census years
-   Create functions generic enough to apply to any disaster (or other) boundary

# Data sources

## Wildfire perimeters

Historic wildfire GIS information is maintained by the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC).

NIFC data are distributed through ArcGIS Online products:

-   Hosted feature layers
-   Esri Hub ("Open Data") site

These sources can be queried using the `{arcgislayers}` package [@arcgislayers].

```{r}
#| output: false
#| echo: false
library(tidycensus)
library(tigris)
library(sf)
library(arcgislayers)
library(tidyverse)
library(patchwork)
library(mapboxapi)
options(tigris_use_cache = T)
st_basemap <- tigris::states(cb = T,
                             resolution = "20m") |>
  shift_geometry()
```

## Census information

The functions I've written for this project lean heavily on Kyle Walker's `{tigris}` [-@tigris] and `{tidycensus}` [-@tidycensus] packages.

-   Increase performance by only downloading required counties and tracts
-   Provide an easy spatial filter for NIFC data, by using the `filter_geom` argument in `arc_read()`

# Gathering and cleaning wildfire data

## Define the New Mexico boundary

```{r}
#| echo: true
nm <- tigris::states() |>
  filter(STUSPS == "NM") 
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = st_basemap) +
  geom_sf(data = nm,
          fill = "#ad5044") +
  theme_void()
```

## Get the wildfire perimeters

```{r}
#| echo: true
nm_fires <- arcgislayers::arc_read(r"(https://services3.arcgis.com/T4QMspbfLg3qTGWY/ArcGIS/rest/services/InterAgencyFirePerimeterHistory_All_Years_View/FeatureServer/0)",
  where = "FIRE_YEAR BETWEEN 2010 AND 2020",
  filter_geom = st_as_sfc(nm)
) |>
  st_make_valid(geos_method = "valid_linework") |>
  distinct(toupper(INCIDENT), .keep_all = T) |>
  slice_max(
    order_by = Shape__Area,
    n = 10
  ) |>
  select(-`toupper(INCIDENT)`) |>
  mutate(COMMENTS = str_trunc(COMMENTS, 35))
```

::: callout-note
The NIFC data is much less clean than the Census data; we have to validate geometry and de-duplicate incidents. In addition, many of the comment-writers had lots to say -- we'll truncate the `COMMENTS` field to 35 characters.

## Put them together

```{r fig.align='center'}
mapview::mapview(nm,
                 layer.name = "New Mexico",
                 alpha.regions = 0,
                 color = "#007A86",
                 col.regions = "#007A86",
                 lwd = 3,
                 hover = NULL,
                 label = "STUSPS") +
mapview::mapview(nm_fires,
                 layer.name = "Wildfires",
                 color = "#ad5044",
                 col.regions = "#ad5044",
                 label = "INCIDENT")
```

The cumulative area of these fires is `r round(sum(nm_fires$Shape__Area)/2589988.110336, 2)` square miles. However, there are other impacts that are not apparent by only looking at the burned land area.

# Relating demographic information to wildfire

## Determining a temporal range

-   An analyst must define what is meant by "before" and "after" an event, particularly when using 5-year ACS estimates
    -   Default setting is 2 years before, 3 years after
    -   Can be changed using `years_before` and `years_after` parameters, but must still be \>= 5 years

## Finding intersecting counties and tracts

-   To calculate the difference in demographic characteristics before and after an event, we'll use census tracts
    -   Determine which tracts an event boundary intersects with before and after it occurs
    -   `get_counties_all_years()` and `get_tracts_all_years()`
        -   Use `st_filter()` to determine which tracts an event boundary intersects with

## Relating tract data to events

-   Each event in the input `sf` object is spatially joined to the tracts it intersects with before and after
    -   A set of unique state, county, and year combinations is generated to improve performance
    -   `map_data()` is applied to iterate `get_acs()` across these combinations
        -   Common variables as well as user-defined variables

## Summarize ACS data and join to events

-   Most impactful events are large enough to affect more than one Census tract
    -   Estimates are aggregated across event boundaries
        -   Support for extensive and intensive variables is included

## ACS Variables {.smaller}

| Variable starts with... | Function to be computed |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| `mean`                  | `mean()`                |
| `median`                | `median()`              |
| All other strings       | `sum()`                 |

Default variables include:

```{r}

The final output object is an `sf` object, returned in either `"tidy"` (the default) or `"wide"` format.

)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false

```

## And some maps!

```{r}
nm_fires_impact_mhhi <- nm_fires_impact |>
  filter(variable == "pop_hisp") |>
  mutate(map_label = paste0(data_yr, ": ", computed))

mapview::mapview(filter(nm_fires_impact_mhhi, 
                        pt_in_time == "before"),
                 layer.name = "Hispanic/Latino Population (Pre-event)",
                 zcol = "computed",
                 col.regions = RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(9,"YlGnBu"),
                 label = "map_label",
                 map.types = "CartoDB.Positron") | 
  mapview::mapview(filter(nm_fires_impact_mhhi,
                          pt_in_time == "after"),
                 layer.name = "Hispanic/Latino Population (Post-event)",
                 zcol = "computed",
                 col.regions = RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(9,"YlGnBu"),
                 label = "map_label",
                 map.types = "CartoDB.Positron")
```

Using `output = "tidy"` allows us to compare one variable easily over time.

## And more maps!

```{r}
nm_fires_impact_wide_hisp <- nm_fires_impact_wide |>
  mutate(map_label = case_when(pop_hisp > 0 ~ paste0(acs_vintage, ": +", pop_hisp),
                               TRUE ~ paste0(acs_vintage, ": ", pop_hisp))) |>
  add_row(pop_hisp = -959)

mapview::mapview(nm_fires_impact_wide_hisp,
                 layer.name = "Change in Hispanic/Latino Population, Pre- vs. Post-event",
                 zcol = "pop_hisp",
                 col.regions = RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(9,"RdYlBu"),
                 lwd = 0.5,
                 label = "map_label",
                 map.types = "CartoDB.Positron") 
```

Using `output = "wide"` allows us to compare differences in one variable easily across multiple events.

# In Conclusion

## Findings

The Wallow Fire (2011) had the most severe impact on the Hispanic and Latino populations based on this methodology.

-   Hispanic/Latino population decreased by 442 individuals between 2009 and 2014
-   Total population decreased by over 4,300 people
-   School enrollment decreased by 1,479 pupils.

## Further applications

The way that I've constructed this project allows it to be easily extended to other topics, not just wildfire:

-   Other urban disasters, like flooding
-   Positive events (like a new transit station opening)
-   A novel polygon, to see change in a region over time

## Difficulties and limitations

-   Data is returned by `tigris` with different column names depending on the vintage used
-   ACS estimates are only available from 2009, so impacts can only be calculated for events occurring in 2010 onwards
-   Calculated differences (when `output = "wide"`) can only be absolute
    -   If an initial state is 0, then a relative difference cannot be calculated

## What the project does well

-   Written in such a way it can be converted to a package relatively easily
-   Provides a good counterpart to existing disaster planning tools
    -   [OnTheMap for Emergency Management](https://onthemap.ces.census.gov/em/)
-   Does not calculate an impact index
    -   What is a negative social characteristic?

## One last example

The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) opened a series of metro rail stations through Northern Virginia on July 26, 2014, in the Phase 1 extension of the Silver Line [@a2015_dulles]. These stations include Greensboro, McLean, Spring Hill, Tysons, and Wiehle–Reston East.

Using the above methodology, we can investigate the question: **what was the impact of opening these stations on the surrounding areas?**

## Using transit data

According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, most pedestrians are willing to walk a quarter to a half a mile to a transit stop [-@nabors_2008_pedestrian]. We can compute a polygon for the upper bound of this estimate using the `mapboxapi` package.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output: false
wmata_stops <- st_read("data/wmata_silver_p1.gpkg", layer = "wmata_silver_p1")
hf_mi_stops <- mb_isochrone(wmata_stops, 
                            profile = "walking", 
                            distance = c(805), 
                            id_column = "stop_id") |>
  mutate(stop_yr = 2014) |>
  left_join(st_drop_geometry(select(wmata_stops, c(stop_id, stop_name))),
            by = join_by(id == stop_id))
```

## Using transit data

```{r}
mapview::mapview(hf_mi_stops,
                 layer.name = "Half-mile walk from Silver Line Phase 1 stations",
                 label = "stop_name")
```

## Calculating differences over time

```{r}
#| echo: true
wmata_impact <- get_incident_impacts(hf_mi_stops,
                                     id,
                                     stop_yr,
                                     output = "tidy")

```

```{r}
wmata_impact_tpop <- wmata_impact |>
  filter(variable == "pop_total") |>
  mutate(map_label = paste0(data_yr, ": ", computed))

mapview::mapview(filter(wmata_impact_tpop, 
                        pt_in_time == "before"),
                 layer.name = "Total Population (before SL Phase 1)",
                 zcol = "computed",
                 col.regions = RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(9,"YlGnBu"),
                 label = "map_label",
                 map.types = "CartoDB.Positron") | 
  mapview::mapview(filter(wmata_impact_tpop,
                          pt_in_time == "after"),
                 layer.name = "Total Population (after SL Phase 1)",
                 zcol = "computed",
                 col.regions = RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(9,"YlGnBu"),
                 label = "map_label",
                 map.types = "CartoDB.Positron")
```

## Calculating differences over time

                                     output = "wide")
```

                               TRUE ~ paste0(acs_vintage, ": ", pop_total)))

mapview::mapview(wmata_impact_wide_tpop,
                 layer.name = "Change in Total Population, Pre- vs. Post-SL Phase 1",

                 col.regions = RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(9,"RdYlBu"),
                 lwd = 0.5,
                 label = "map_label",
                 map.types = "CartoDB.Positron")
