## Final Project Proposal: Quantifying the local impact of wildfire on demographic factors

### Harrison DeFord

This repository contains information and scripts related to my final project for GES 668: Building Spatial Datasets, with Eli Pousson at UMBC.

It shows a user how to access NIFC interagency fire perimeters from within R, and then uses this data to demonstrate a function I've written to compare demographic data from before and after an event â€“ see proposal.qmd or proposal.html (or, see it on my website [here](https://oonuttlet.github.io/posts/668_project_proposal/)!).
