## GES 486 Final Project Scripts

These three scripts are data preparation and manipulation scripts:

[Script 1](start_end_join.Rmd)

[Script 2](scooter_analysis.Rmd)

[Script 3](flow_diagram.Rmd)

This final script produces HTML widgets, which are interactive in 3 dimensions, to smybolize scooter flows. It only uses data collected on May 1, 2022 (due to hardware restraints).

[Script 4](hexagons.Rmd)

[This HTML](scooter_locations.Rmd) is what I presented in class, and incorporates elements from all of the above scripts.

It uses data collected the week of 05/01/2022 through 05/07/2022 to output maps on scooter locations compared to BIPOC population and job and population location.
